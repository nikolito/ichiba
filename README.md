# Ogi Nikki
Ogi Nikki is business records of Ogi Domain, called Ogi Han, at Edo era  (1600 - 1868) in Saga, Japan.
Ogi Han was one of feudal domains based on a tax system in Edo era and settled as an affiliation of [Saga Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saga_Domain).
The number of the titles which represent the records is assumed about 100,000. The records contain when, where, who and what happen in Ogi Han. 
The original records are hand-writing, called Kuzushi-ji. The Center for Regional Culture and History, Saga University, has been translating into Japanese texts. 
You can browse the results of the translation as a manner of [a digital archive](https://www.dl.saga-u.ac.jp/ogiNikki/)

# OgiNikki Projects
By 2019, more than 30,000 titles are converted into texts and stored in the archive.
I have tried to convert the data of the archive into [Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data).

# Linked Data
I suppose linked data is a future-oriented data. The important merit is that linked data can include information of structured relationships about the data's attributes and annotations, not only the values. This means even if your archives have gone for some reasons, you can restore your archives much better and easier again because you don't miss "information" of fields of data.
In other words, when you loose "meanings" of the fields, you loose how to "use" the data. 

Linked Data can also describe relationships on an instance level. For example, you can pick up some keywords (parts of speech) from values written in natural sentence and categolize some groups.
