# Ogi Nikki
Ogi Nikki is business records of Ogi Domain, called Ogi Han, at Edo era  (1600 - 1868) in Saga, Japan.
Ogi Han was one of feudal domains based on a tax system in Edo era and settled as an affiliation of [Saga Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saga_Domain).
The number of the titles which represent the records is assumed about 100,000. The records contain when, where, who and what happen in Ogi Han. 
The original records are hand-writing, called Kuzushi-ji. The Center for Regional Culture and History, Saga University, has been translating into Japanese texts. 
You can browse the results of the translation as a manner of [a digital archive](https://www.dl.saga-u.ac.jp/ogiNikki/)

# OgiNikki Projects
By 2019, more than 30,000 titles are converted into texts and stored in the archive.
I have tried to convert data of the archive into [Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data).
